Currently live in Hampshire in the United Kingdom with my girlfriend and two mischieves house rabbits having moved from Cornwall in the early 90s.

Software developer by trade, my first exposure to computers was with a Sinclair ZX 81 that my Dad bought in an auction at Penair school fate. The ZX 81 was sold with 16k RAM pack and a few games to start us off, the only thing that was missing was the cassette recorder to load the games. I needn't of worried as that same afternoon we shopped for a cassette recorder in the local Dixons store and by the evening were deep into a wonderland of text adventure games, "N" for North, "I" for itinerary and "S" for slash to help slay the baddies.

It was soon after that I took an interest in the computer itself and was regularly helping out in the lunchtime computer club programming a Research Machines 380Z. At home we moved on to a Commodore 64, my choice, the ZX Spectrum was all the rage but I felt the commodore was a better machine and we purchased one with a 1541 commodore disc drive which was necessary as it was the only way to obtain the Commodore technical software such as the Assembly language.

Initially teaching myself Commodore basic before moving on to more advanced techniques such as accessing memory locations directly via Peek and Poke commands. Back then the documentation supplied with the Commodore 64 included schematics, information about the chips and memory addresses, having this detailed information helped in taking a step up from poking memory addresses with DATA statements and moving on to Assembler learning the mnemonics. During this time I was supplying magazines with small listings for users to type in, tips n' tricks and the occasional cheat for popular games assisted by a Datel Action replay catridge.

Fortunately for me the tinkering with programming at home has assisted me in my career, although home computers have all but gone away the resurgence of smaller less powerful enthusiast machines such as Raspberry Pi and boards such as Intel Galileo and Arduino are leading to a new breed of pioneers, just like it was in the 80s.

Outside of work my hobbies and interests include
- cars or more specifically sports cars
- HiFi as I like my music to sound good, do you want MP3 or 24/96
- Artificial Intelligence, machine learning
- Progress of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathmatics (STEM)

and basically electronics, robotics, gadgets, smart home and anything with clever design!

I care about looking after the environment and making the world a beautiful place for the future.

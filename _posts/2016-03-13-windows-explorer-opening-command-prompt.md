I think most people know that you can open a command prompt by clicking on the Start Button or Window icon and typing "cmd" or "command"

If you want to launch the command Window with administrator priveleges you select the icon, right click and choose "Run as administrator", common knowledge.

But I learnt something new today, in Windows 7/8/8.1 and 10 you can launch the command prompt from the Windows Explorer address bar by typing cmd and pressing return.

A command prompt is opened and will automatically be in the folder that you were viewing in Windows Explorer.

## What is Sphero?

![sphero]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/posts/2014-11-24-sphero/sphero.jpg){: .align-center}

Sphero is a round robot toy about the size of a tennis ball and is made of polycarbonate plastic.

Everything you need to get started comes inside the Sphero box,you’ll find a Sphero toy, a power pack, base station with wireless charging,
some ramps and an instruction booklet.

Once charged Sphero is controlled by a Tablet or Smartphone running Bluetooth 4.0.

Sphero is being advertised and marketed as a toy but is gathering momentum as an educational robot.

Inside Sphero are circuit boards that contain an accelerometer and a gyroscope, there are also some nice brightly coloured LED lights.

Sphero is produced and supported by a company called Orbitox (now called Sphero).


## Why am I interested in Sphero

Because I am a big kid, an electronic salesman’s dream and love gadgets. You might be interested in Sphero for the same reason or have
children that are interested in electronics and software.

## Using Sphero

The first thing you’ll need to do is charge Sphero, simply pop it on to the base station and wait, a flashing light indicates Sphero is being
charged and the process takes around three to five hours.

To control Sphero you’ll need a Bluetooth 4.0 enabled smartphone, tablet or laptop (all of these are known as a smart devices). The easiest
way to play with Sphero is to download the free applications created by Orbitox, I’d recommend that you start with the Sphero application
first.

### Start to play!

Take Sphero off his charging stand and Tap to wake, enable Bluetooth on your smart device and in the Bluetooth device list select Sphero-
ROR. NB: Sphero can only be paired with one device at a time.

Launch the Sphero application

![start-to-play]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/posts/2014-11-24-sphero/start-to-play.jpg){: .align-center}

The Sphero application will search for a connected Sphero device

![connected]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/posts/2014-11-24-sphero/connected.jpg){: .align-center}

When device is found you can start to play. The main screen consists of a virtual joystick to move Sphero and settings to modify his speed,
change the colour of his LED lights and adjust his orientation.

![main-control-screen]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/posts/2014-11-24-sphero/main-control-screen.jpg){: .align-center}

This application is quite good fun, Sphero is very rapid at full speed so you’ll need to ensure that you have plenty of space as it will no doubt
end up hitting furniture, friends and household pets. The device is very robust but after a few high speed collisions with inanimate objects it
will pick up scuffs and scrapes.

## Programming Sphero

The pre-built applications and games are a great way to introduce a new user to Sphero, you can make it race, spin and flash the LED lights
with very little effort but all good things must come to an end so what will keep you coming back to Sphero?

Thanks to the likes of the Raspberry Pi and Arduino boards there seems to have been resurgence in electronics and software with many
schools using the cheaper devices to help educate the next generation of engineers and I think this is a good thing. The makers of Sphero
have responded to this rise in demand for cheap electronics and recently released a special version of the Sphero called SPRK (Schools,
Parents,Robots,Kids); the SPRK edition is the same as a regular Sphero but has a transparent case so budding electronics experts can better
view the circuit board. The SPRK also comes with ideas for running educational course with Sphero.

![sphero-sprk]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/posts/2014-11-24-sphero/sphero-sprk.jpg){: .align-center}

[more information here](http://www.sphero.com/education)

SPRK is a positive move to include robots, electronics and software in education but you don’t have to be in the SPRK program to be able to
enjoy programming Sphero.

You have to rewind twenty or thirty years ago to see how programming was made accessible outside of academic establishments with the
advent of home computers that natively ran BASIC (Beginers All purpose Symbolic Instruction Code), coding was as simple as turning the
machine on and entering the instructions. Some modern languages are complex in structure and are simplified when using integrated
development environments (IDE) that will syntax check your code, perform compilation, linking and running of your program. Seasoned
developers have realised that starting to code is not as easy as it once was and there have been many attempts to make a simpler language
designed to harness the skills required to program, often the languages are aimed at children and there have been various attempts at
producing a Kids Programming Language.

Enter Tablet computing with its bright, colourful and simple user interfaces (UI). This seemingly simple but incredibly complex device has
spawned a whole new generation of visual programming aids in the form of bring your own block programming languages (BYOB) such as
Scratch and Snap! Wouldn’t it be great if these languages could also control robots?

## Programming – Beginner to Intermediate

While Sphero can be controlled with Scratch or Snap! two of the easiest visual languages to use are Tickle and Tynker.

### Tickle

![tickle-splash]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/posts/2014-11-24-sphero/tickle-splash.jpg){: .align-center}

Tickle is a free application and available from an App store.  Download it and open the Tickle application, the robot support in Tickle is
excellent simply selecting “New Project” from the home screen will display a list of program templates for a variety of devices including the
Philips Hue lights.

![tickle-automation]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/posts/2014-11-24-sphero/tickle-automation.jpg){: .align-center}

When a template is selected the development area is displayed, the left hand side of the screen contains the building blocks and the right
hand side is the code. The building blocks are formed of generic blocks (such as conditions and branches) as well as blocks specific to the
template that you chose, for Sphero the specific blocks have a picture of the Sphero device on them. To program the device you need to
select a block on the left hand side and drag it across the right hand side, the blocks link together like a jigsaw puzzle and looping blocks are
indented.

Starting your first program is easy, the template contains a simple program to change Sphero’s colour and then proceed to move the
Sphero in a square.

![tickle-block-programming]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/posts/2014-11-24-sphero/tickle-block-programming.jpg){: .align-center}

Overall Tickle is very simply to use, there are some nice demo applications, there is good support for various devices but coding is very
basic.

### Tynker

![tynker-splash]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/posts/2014-11-24-sphero/tynker-splash.jpg){: .align-center}

Tynker is a free application and available from an App Store. Download and open the Tynker application, there are two modes to choose
from “play” or “create”.

![tynker-play-or-create]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/posts/2014-11-24-sphero/tynker-play-or-create.jpg){: .align-center}

Play mode includes three free games, Crash Course is designed for Sphero, other games are available to download but there may be a cost
involved. Create mode is for the budding programmer.

Selecting create lets you open an existing project or create a new one. 

![tynker-create]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/posts/2014-11-24-sphero/tynker-create.jpg){: .align-center}

Tynker is slightly different from Tickle in that you are initially presented with a stage and have to add actors; Sphero is one such actor, the
default actor is a very cartoonish purple monster, clicking plus allows you to add more actors.

![tynker-default-actor]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/posts/2014-11-24-sphero/tynker-default-actor.jpg){: .align-center}

Most actors are cartoon characters, if you want robots then they are called connected devices.

![tynker-select-theme]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/posts/2014-11-24-sphero/tynker-select-theme.jpg){: .align-center}

The list of devices you can use with Tynker isn’t as comprehensive as Tickle but it does contain Sphero and Ollie!

![tynker-list-of-devices]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/posts/2014-11-24-sphero/tynker-list-of-devices.jpg){: .align-center}

After selecting the Sphero actor you can bring up a graphical controller, with the controller you can set the orientation, change the LED light
colours and move Sphero around the floor, this is great for those who procrastinate before coding or if you just want a five minute break to
play with Sphero.

![tynker-sphero-actor]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/posts/2014-11-24-sphero/tynker-sphero-actor.jpg){: .align-center}

After you have whizzed Sphero around the playfield (aka the floor) you can settle down to program Sphero. The visual development
experience is very similar to Tickle, dragging and dropping building blocks onto the main development area. However there are more
options and Tickle caters for more advanced programming topics such as functions.

![tynker-block-programming]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/posts/2014-11-24-sphero/tynker-block-programming.jpg){: .align-center}

Tickle is immediately accessible as a programming tool but I can see Tynker giving more longevity.

## MacroLab

Orbotix (now Sphero) have a basic programming application called MacroLab which allows the programmer to select from a pre-defined set
of macro’s.

![macrolab-macros]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/posts/2014-11-24-sphero/macrolab-macros.jpg){: .align-center}

This application is really a first attempt to demonstrate what can be done with Sphero, having the macros in plain English without any
(major) programming concepts could be its strength but I think that the visual building block programs will have more appeal.

![macrolab-commands]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/posts/2014-11-24-sphero/macrolab-commands.jpg){: .align-center}

## SPRK (Schools, Parents, Robots, Kids)

![sphero-sprk-block-splash]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/posts/2014-11-24-sphero/sphero-sprk-block-splash.jpg){: .align-center}

Another application from Orbotix, this one closer resembles other visual block programming languages.

![sphero-sprk-block-programming]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/posts/2014-11-24-sphero/sphero-sprk-block-programming.jpg){: .align-center}

The advantage to using the application is that all of the blocks are dedicated to controlling the Sphero device.

![sphero-sprk-block-programming-control]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/posts/2014-11-24-sphero/sphero-sprk-block-programming-control.jpg){: .align-center}

The product is very easy to use but lacks the visual finesse of Tickle and Tynker.

## Programming – Intermediate

### OrbBasic

OrbBasic from Orbotix is an interesting product, if you are old enough to remember a version of the BASIC language that could have 52
variables, 26 named A to Z for numeric values and 26 named A$ to Z$ for strings values then OrbBasic will be familiar.

The OrbBasic program allows the programmer to write in a BASIC style language on the smart device, when run the program is transmitted
to Sphero and executed.

To start you off there are seven programs

![orbbasic]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/posts/2014-11-24-sphero/orbbasic.jpg){: .align-center}

Luckily this application comes with a comprehensive help screen

![orbbasic-help]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/posts/2014-11-24-sphero/orbbasic-help.jpg){: .align-center}

OrbBasic contains keywords such as print, which might seem a bit obscure as the Sphero does not have a display, when the Sphero
interprets the print command it sends a message back to the smart device console, handy for debugging.

Using OrbBasic requires some patience, there is no IntelliSense or automatic line numbering, there are a lot of pre-built variables that query
the status of the device such as current speed and yaw, because of this you’ll need to switch between the editor and help screens which will
slow down the development. To be fair, once you get to know the commands it is a lot of fun and close to real coding.

![orbbasic-code-console]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/posts/2014-11-24-sphero/orbbasic-code-console.jpg){: .align-center}

## Programming – Advanced

### Kids Ruby

Kids Ruby is a special build of Ruby that includes libraries to simplify the programming process.

Kids Ruby includes some of the Ruby libraries that have been written for Sphero (see [http://kidsruby.com/](http://kidsruby.com/) and or view the [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0iF1YOEU58).

The Kids Ruby project is interesting but seems to have lost momentum over the past year or two.

### Ruby (for grown-ups)

This is really where I wanted to start with the blog post, I bought Sphero so that I could improve my knowledge of Ruby and have fun
programming Sphero but to be honest I really loved playing with the educational languages.

### Alternative Languages

There are lots of [developer resources](https://developer.gosphero.com/) available for Sphero so take your pick of programming language, there are even some collaborations with other popular technologies such as

- [Unity 3D](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/7015)
- [Leap Motion](https://developer.leapmotion.com/gallery/leap-motion-sphero)

## Educational robots

Sphero is quite expensive, currently retails between £89 and £129 (or more if you want the soon to be released BB-8 edition), the SPRK is around £99, if you don’t
want your Sphero damaged you’ll need to invest in a Nubby cover.

Orbotix also sell another robot called Ollie. Ollie is a hard wearing robot that can be used in the dirt track of a garden. Ollie retails for
between £59 and £79 and represents slightly better value than Sphero.

Introducing robots into the household does not need to be expensive or require lots of technical ability.

Other fun and educational robots include

Ozobot [http://www.ozobot.com](http://www.ozobot.com/)
Dot and Dash [(https://www.makewonder.com](https://www.makewonder.com/)
Lego Mindstorms [http://www.lego.com/en-us/mindstorms](http://www.lego.com/en-us/mindstorms)

However if you are really taking robotics seriously and money is no object then how about acquiring [Nao](https://www.aldebaran.com/en/humanoid-robot/nao-robot) or [Robotis Darwin](http://en.robotis.com/model/board.php?bo_table=print_en&wr_id=39)?  

If you get one of these then let me know!
